## Installation Guide  

### üõ†Ô∏è Step 1: Clone the Repository  
To begin, clone the repository from GitHub to your local machine using the following command:  

git clone https://github.com/your-username/uwrs.git

Navigate into the project directory:


cd uwrs
## Step 2: Set Up a Virtual Environment
Create a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies:


python -m venv venv  
Activate the virtual environment:

For Windows:


venv\Scripts\activate  
For macOS/Linux:


source venv/bin/activate  
## Step 3: Install Dependencies
With the virtual environment activated, install the required dependencies using:


pip install -r requirements.txt
Setting Up Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory and add the following:


# General
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key


# Cloudinary
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret

# Email (Flask-Mail)
MAIL_SERVER=smtp.gmail.com
MAIL_PORT=587
MAIL_USE_TLS=True
MAIL_USERNAME=your_email@gmail.com
MAIL_PASSWORD=your_email_password
Database Setup
Initialize and apply migrations to set up the database:


flask db init
flask db migrate -m "Initial migration"
flask db upgrade
(Optional) If you want to seed initial data into the database, run:


python seed.py
Running the Application
Start the backend server using:


flask run
By default, the server runs on http://127.0.0.1:5000.

vercel --prod
Troubleshooting & Common Issues
Virtual Environment Not Activating (Windows)
If the virtual environment doesn't activate, try:

venv\Scripts\activate of venv\Scripts\activate.ps1
If that fails, run:

Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process
Database Migrations Not Working
If migrations fail, reset and re-run them:

flask db downgrade
flask db migrate
flask db upgrade
Cloudinary Image Upload Fails
Check your .env file and ensure CLOUDINARY_API_KEY is set correctly.
